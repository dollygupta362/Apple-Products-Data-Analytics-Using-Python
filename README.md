<h1 align="center">📱 Apple Products Data Analytics (Python Project)</h1>

Welcome to the **Apple Products Data Analytics** project!  
This is a focused **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** project built using **Python**, designed to uncover insights from Apple’s product listings — including pricing trends, customer reviews, discounts, and star ratings.

The project now includes **7 interactive visualizations** using both `Plotly` and `pandas` to analyze Apple product performance and understand customer behavior.

## 📘 About the Project

This analysis uses a structured dataset containing product listings for Apple iPhones and other Apple products.  
It includes information such as **product name, price, MRP, rating, RAM, discount, and review volume**.

The goals of this project were to:
- Explore pricing, rating, and discount patterns
- Analyze customer engagement via reviews and rating counts
- Visualize relationships between product features and popularity
- Provide **business-ready insights** using Python and Plotly

## 📂 Data Source

- 📄 **apple_products.csv**  
  Contains:
  - Product ID, Product Name, Category
  - MRP, Sale Price, Discount %, RAM
  - Star Rating, Number of Ratings & Reviews

---

## 📈 Visualizations Included (7 Plots)

1. **Number of Ratings for Highest Rated iPhones**  
   → Analyzes how many customers reviewed the best-rated products.
2. **Top 10 Most Rated Apple Products**  
   → Identifies the most popular (most-reviewed) Apple devices.
3. **Sale Price vs Star Rating (colored by RAM)**  
   → Explores customer satisfaction across different price and performance tiers.
4. **RAM Variant Distribution**  
   → Visualizes how Apple segments products by memory configuration.
5. **Top 10 Most Rated Products (in K)**  
   → Highlights high-engagement products with clear `k`-formatted labels.
6. **Histogram of Discount Amounts (₹)**  
   → Shows how much Apple typically discounts its products.
7. **Number of Ratings vs Discount Percentage**  
   → Explores whether higher discounts lead to more customer engagement.

## 🔍 Sample Insights

- 🌟 **High Star Ratings Don’t Always Mean Popularity**  
  Some top-rated iPhones have very few total ratings — reflecting niche appeal rather than mass popularity.

- 👥 **Popular ≠ Best Rated**  
  The most reviewed products aren’t always the highest rated — showing a clear trade-off between volume and quality.

- 💸 **Price ≠ Rating**  
  No consistent relationship between sale price and average star rating. Mid-range models perform just as well as premium ones.

- 🧠 **2GB & 3GB RAM Dominate**  
  Most Apple products in this dataset come with 2–3GB RAM, hinting at the inclusion of legacy models.

- 📊 **Discounting Strategy is Conservative**  
  Majority of discounts fall in the ₹5k–₹10k range. Very few products receive aggressive markdowns — showing Apple's premium pricing model.

- 🔄 **Higher Discounts ≠ More Ratings**  
  Surprisingly, phones with deeper discounts didn’t necessarily receive more reviews or ratings.
