<h1 align="center">📱 Apple Products Data Analytics (Python Project)</h1>

Welcome to the **Apple Products Data Analytics** project!  
This is a focused **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** project built using **Python**, designed to uncover insights from Apple’s product listings — including pricing trends, reviews, and product ratings.

The project uses `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib` to identify patterns in product performance and help understand what influences customer engagement and purchasing decisions.

## 📘 About the Project

This analysis uses a structured dataset containing product listings for Apple iPhones and other Apple products.  
It includes information such as **product name, price, rating, review count, and category**.

The main goals of this project were to:
- Explore pricing patterns and product segmentation
- Analyze customer engagement through ratings and reviews
- Derive actionable business insights using Python-based data exploration

## 📂 Data Source

- 📄 **apple_products.csv**  
  Contains:
  - Product ID, Product Name
  - Category, Price, Rating
  - Number of Reviews

---

## 📌 What You'll Find in the Analysis

### 🎯 **Key Focus Areas:**
- 📈 Relationship between price, rating, and review count
- 📦 Category-wise product distribution and pricing patterns
- 💬 Customer engagement trends based on review volume
- 🔍 High-performing and underperforming product segments

---

## 🔍 Sample Insights

- 💸 **High-Priced Products Don't Always Have High Ratings**  
  There’s no strong correlation between price and rating — some mid-range products outperform expensive ones in user satisfaction.

- 🌟 **High Review Counts Signal Customer Trust**  
  Products with more than **5000 reviews** are mostly priced between **₹60,000 – ₹90,000**, indicating a sweet spot for popular iPhones.

- 🧺 **Smartphones Dominate Apple Sales Listings**  
  The majority of products belong to the **smartphone** category, but wearables and accessories are gaining visibility.

- 🛍️ **Price Distribution is Heavily Skewed**  
  Most products are priced below ₹1,00,000, with a few ultra-premium devices exceeding ₹1,50,000 — revealing Apple’s luxury pricing strategy.
